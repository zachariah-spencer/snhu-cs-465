# CS465 - Full Stack Development Final Project
In building the full stack project, I explored several approaches to frontend development and saw how Express HTML templates, vanilla JavaScript, and a single-page application each offered distinct advantages. Express HTML allowed rapid server-side rendering, which is ideal for straightforward pages needing minimal interactivity. Vanilla JavaScript gave me fine-grained control over client-side behavior but required more manual DOM manipulation. The SPA, however, provided a seamless user experience by handling routing and rendering entirely on the client, which significantly reduced page reloads and enabled faster interactions. On the backend, I leveraged a MongoDB NoSQL database because its schema-less nature fit well with the evolving data needs of the application and allowed for flexible document structures that could easily accommodate new fields without migration overhead. JSON served as the bridge between frontend and backend, delivering serialized data objects that both sides could understand and manipulate. Its lightweight format made data transmission efficient and its compatibility with JavaScript kept transformations minimal. Throughout the build, I refactored components to eliminate repetition by consolidating utility functions, extracting reusable UI components, and rearchitecting modules to share logic. This yielded easier maintenance and improved load times.

Testing endpoints in this environment emphasized the importance of understanding HTTP methods, resource paths, and the layering of security such as authentication and authorization. For instance, I had to confirm that POST requests returned correct status codes and that protected routes only responded when valid tokens were present. Integrating API tests into the deployment pipeline ensured that changes could be validated quickly. This course helped me grow professionally by deepening my understanding of full stack workflows, from designing RESTful APIs to structuring SPAs and crafting secure data flows. I have honed skills in modular component design, API testing strategies, and database modeling, all of which make me more competitive in the job market and better prepared to handle real-world full stack challenges.
